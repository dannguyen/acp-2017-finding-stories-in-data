## Get involved with crowdsourced data journalism

Other than learning how to use a spreadsheet and to use it everyday for all of your note and record taking (journalism related or not) -- if you want to do data journalism, then join a crowdsourced project. Help them build data for the public, and get first-hand experience of how the nitty-gritty of data collection becomes the fuel for accountability stories.

Data entry is always dull, but it is **always necessary**. Might as well get into it by doing data entry for a great journalistic purpose.

A few ongoing, nationwide projects:

- [Fatal Encounters](http://www.fatalencounters.org/) - A project started by an independent journalist who recognized long before Ferguson how pitiful the official record-keeping was for police shootings.
- [Documenting Hate](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/hatecrimes) - ProPublica's initiative to collect and count hate crimes and bias incidents and to create a national dataset. 
- [TrumpWorld](https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/help-us-map-trumpworld) - BuzzFeed has logged more than 1,500 of the Trump Administration's business and personal connections. Use their spreadsheet and help them find more connections. ([Github repo](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/trumpworld))

## How-tos and Reflections

What I love most about data-driven journalism is how its stories can be done in the open, not dependent on privileged access but on a reporter's willingness to work through the data and details. Consequently, the "How I did this" are not just inspirational, but of high practical value.
